Dear Visitor,

Welcome, and thank you for stopping by!

I'm Waradon Senzt (Phokhinanan), based in Paris and collaborating with partners in Thailand. I'm not very active on this platform, so please feel free to visit my website at waradon.dev or connect with me on LinkedIn.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience at ENS-PSL in Paris, where my work focuses on encoding and decoding neuronal spike data. My research interests are expanding into theoretical neuroscience and statistical physics as well.

I am interested in biomimetic technology for machine perception. My current research focuses on bio-inspired models for machine hearing and robot audition of all types of sound
(including speech and music), such as auditory features and computational auditory scene analysis.
