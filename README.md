Dear Visitor,

Welcome, and thank you for stopping by!

I'm Waradon Senzt (Phokhinanan), based in Paris and collaborating with partners in Thailand. I’m not very active on this platform and generally push my code here. For more updates or to connect, please visit my website at waradon.dev or find me on LinkedIn.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience at ENS-PSL in Paris, where my work focuses on encoding and decoding neuronal spike data. I’m particularly passionate about perception studies, mainly in auditory pathways—though I’m exploring other sensory modalities as well. My broader interests include theoretical neuroscience and statistical physics. My thesis examines spatial attention in the auditory cortex and how sound representations are encoded.

Beyond my PhD work, I’m developing neural network architectures inspired by the biological auditory system, and I plan to submit two AI conference papers this year. My goal is to integrate these models into further neuroscientific research.

I’m always open to discussing science, engineering, and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out if you’d like to chat!
